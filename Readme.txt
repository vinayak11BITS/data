Load the dataset “prisoners.csv” using pandas and display the first and
last five rows in the dataset.Use describe method in pandas and find out the number of columns. Can
you say something about those rows who have zero inmates?
Create a new column -’total_benefitted’ that is a sum of inmates
benefitted through all modes.Create a new row - “totals” that is the sum of all inmates benefitted
through each mode across all states.Make a bar plot with each state name on the x -axis and their total
benefitted inmates as their bar heights. Which state has the maximum
number of beneficiaries?Make a pie chart that depicts the ratio among different modes of
benefits.

Key issues
Clearly establish a correlation among the parameters supplied in data

Approx 500 records – file FyntraCustomerData.csv (All data is fake so do not worry
about privacy)

1 Use seaborn to create a jointplot to compare the Time on Website
and Yearly Amount Spent columns. Is there a correlation?
2.Do the same as above but now with Time on App and Yearly
Amount Spent. Is this correlation stronger than 1st One?
3.Explore types of relationships across the entire data set using
pairplot . Based off this plot what looks to be the most correlated feature with
Yearly Amount Spent?
4. Create linear model plot of Length of Membership and Yearly
Amount Spent. Does the data fits well in linear plot?
5. Train and Test the data and answer multiple questions -- What is
the use of random_state=85?
6. Predict the data and do a scatter plot.
