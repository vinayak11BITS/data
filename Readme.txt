Load the dataset “prisoners.csv” using pandas and display the first and
last five rows in the dataset.Use describe method in pandas and find out the number of columns. Can
you say something about those rows who have zero inmates?
Create a new column -’total_benefitted’ that is a sum of inmates
benefitted through all modes.Create a new row - “totals” that is the sum of all inmates benefitted
through each mode across all states.Make a bar plot with each state name on the x -axis and their total
benefitted inmates as their bar heights. Which state has the maximum
number of beneficiaries?Make a pie chart that depicts the ratio among different modes of
benefits.
